# Hi, I'm Kaan! 👋

I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Dokuz Eylül University. I am passionate about crafting user-friendly interfaces, building scalable systems, and working with modern web architectures. Currently, I mainly develop projects within the **Next.js** ecosystem, while also deepening my understanding of core software principles through project-based learning in **C# and OOP** (such as building a console game from scratch).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
* **Backend & Database:** Node.js, MongoDB
* **Other:** C#, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are some of the key projects I've been developing (Codebases are currently private due to client confidentiality or ongoing development):

* **BBT Web Platform (BlueRayX3/bbt):** The official website for our university's Computer Science Community (BBT), which I developed entirely from scratch as a solo developer. I built the content management and user interaction flows using modern web standards.
* **Trowas - Digital Business Card:** An NFC-supported digital business card system (similar to Popl) developed for the Babel company. I created a secure and fast infrastructure for sharing user profiles seamlessly.
* **Vegarp (rnaefe/vegarp):** A comprehensive web platform for a popular FiveM server, developed in collaboration with a teammate.
* **AI-Interviewer (BlueRayX3/AI-Interviewer):** An AI-powered interview simulation application.

## 🌱 What I'm Currently Doing

* Deepening my knowledge of Next.js architectures to optimize web application performance.
* Strengthening my core programming skills by developing a C# project without relying on game engines.
* Actively improving my professional English proficiency to leverage my technical skills globally.
